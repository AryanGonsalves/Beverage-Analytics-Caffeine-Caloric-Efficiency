This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis project on caffeine content in popular beverages and its potential health implications. Using a provided dataset of 610 beverages with volume (ml), calories, caffeine (mg) and beverage type (Coffee, Energy Drinks, Energy Shots, Soft Drinks, Tea, Water), we explore how caffeine and calories vary across the market and what that means for safer consumption choices. 

The workflow includes exploratory data analysis (distribution, outliers, and relationships between variables), feature engineering (e.g., caffeine concentration and caffeine-per-calorie efficiency), and multiple statistical tests to compare beverage groups. We test whether average caffeine differs by beverage type using one-way ANOVA and follow up with Tukey HSD for pairwise comparisons. 

To evaluate real-world risk against daily guidelines, we analyze beverages relative to the 400 mg/day threshold cited by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and build predictive models (Random Forest, SVR, ElasticNet) to estimate caffeine content; we also use a logistic regression classifier to flag beverages exceeding the threshold. Results indicate most drinks fall below 400 mg, and items above the limit are primarily in the Coffee category. 

Finally, we examine “caloric efficiency” (caffeine per calorie) using Kruskal–Wallis and post-hoc comparisons, and we run clustering (k-means + hierarchical) to explore market segmentation patterns. Key takeaways highlight strong variation across beverage types, the importance of labeling/high-awareness for very high-caffeine coffees, and how some beverage categories deliver substantially more caffeine per calorie than others.
